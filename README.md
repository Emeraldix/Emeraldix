The Emeraldix official repository<br/>
Emeraldix is a fast-growing open source multi-tasking, multi-user little OS supported by its fan base<br/>
<hr>
<h2>A little about</h2>
Emeraldix - light, fast, and secure x86-x64 OS written from scratch, represents an analogue of Windows, Linux and OS X<hr>
<h2>Here are some of the benefits of Emeraldix:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Freedom - a fully open core allows you to customize the OS beyond recognition</li>
  <li>Security - no one will write Trojans under Emeraldix, it's just unprofitable</li>
  <li>Write software and games in C#? Or maybe in Java and C ++? In any case, we will provide you with the EDK - Emeraldix Developer Kit, which will help you port and distribute your work to Emeraldix</li>
  <li>Speed - Compared to giants such as Windows, Mac OS and Linux, the Emeraldix core has a tiny size and excellent optimization</li>
  <li>Also want to write your OS, but too lazy to touch the assembler? Our Pavo core is a great choice for you.</li>
